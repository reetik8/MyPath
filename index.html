        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> MyPath’s vision is to provide users with customized paths between destinations. The paths are ideally customized by taking the user’s personal information into account. This allows the route provided to avoid certain barriers (i.e. fallen trees for users that may not be able to go over or around them), include specific facilities (i.e. curb cuts for wheelchair users), and avoid unsafe conditions (i.e. terrain that may be difficult for some users to physically navigate). MyPath hopes to crowdsource information to allow for a better algorithm and more real-time updates, allowing users more independence than they may have had in the past.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> Welcome to our MyPath project. The purpose of our project is to build an accessible routing and navigation system for wheelchair users to get to their destination from any source location. We determine accessible routes by classifying surfaces from vibration data. In existing mapping systems, the developers rarely consider the experience of the persons with disabilities in most cases. For example, wheelchair users may encounter steep slopes or other barriers in the built environment which they cannot overcome, or uneven road surfaces and broken sidewalks that are not suitable for wheeled navigation. In order to solve this problem and improve the user experience of wheelchair users, we proposed our MyPath solution. We analye and classify the data collected by sensors and then using the ML model to predict any new surface data available during the testing phase of the system. The road surface information is then updated in a research--oriented open-source mapping system known as the OpenStreetMap (OSM). Finally, we will combine the user's personalized requirements and the accessibility of each road to generate an accessible route for wheelchair users through use of Graphhopper API which is a dedicated routing engine for the OSM.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> The wide variation in user-wheelchair-environment combinations. It is simply impossible to collect data from every different type of user on all possible types of wheelchairs covering all the different surfaces of the world. Therefore, we applied a two-pronged approach to solve this problem. We use a sensor-based data collection and path classification module for training our system on certain amounts of data. We use that data and knowledge to deduce information about other types of users, wheelchairs and surfaces. This project gives a very basic idea of knowledge transfer by the use of transfer learning techniques. Aslo, in response to the darth of a significant amount of sensor generated surface data, we have employed an image based surface classification system in this work. We collected surface images using a car-mounted Go-Pro camera and classified surfaces using a large set of images which we used to train another machine learning model. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that allows you to learn data iteratively and analyze models. Machine learning plays a big role in MyPath projects because we need to analyze the wheelchair travel of a large number of users. When the model encounters new data, we need to use iterations to guide the machine to adapt to the new data independently.</p>

          <h3>Target Audience</h3>
          
          <p class="text-justify">The project’s target audience is people with disabilities which affect their physical movement (i.e. people who use wheelchairs, crutches, etc). The app, however, can be used by anyone in the general public.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Route is determined by an algorithm that takes the user’s personal physical information as well as their ASIA score into account. <br> Users contribute directly to the algorithm by contributing information such as geolocation and sensors. </p>

        <h3>Client Side Working of the App </h3>
        
        <p class="text-justify">The user enters source and destination location coordinates to initiate a route request. The server returns multiple accessible routes with different path features which are then personalized based on user preferences such as acceptable curb heights, or slopes. Also, a textual navigation pane is provided for the chosen route which gives turn-by-turn navigational instructions with distance, time and surface type information to cover each section of the route.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">The road surfaces which users are able to access with a wheelchair, we have used sensor data to train our ML model. In machine learning code, we used 80% supervised learning and 20% unsupervised learning for all models. We decided to use Random Forests(RF) and Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) as final machine learning models. Although deep learning is more expensive, we have still chosen deep learning because machine learning is only a simple level of extraction of feature extraction, and some information with discrimination cannot be extracted effectively. Some models need to be artificially designed or applied to certain features as input to machine learning. After model decision, we have used transfer learning to transfer manual wheelchair dataset to power wheelchair dataset. The reason we used transfer learning is there is significant difference between the two datasets.</p>
