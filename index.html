        <p> MyPath’s vision is to provide users with customized paths between destinations. The paths are ideally customized by taking the user’s personal information into account. This allows the route provided to avoid certain barriers (i.e. fallen trees for users that may not be able to go over or around them), include specific facilities (i.e. curb cuts for wheelchair users), and avoid unsafe conditions (i.e. terrain that may be difficult for some users to physically navigate). MyPath hopes to crowdsource information to allow for a better algorithm and more real-time updates, allowing users more independence than they may have had in the past.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Motivation</h3>
        
        <p> Welcome to the MyPath project. The purpose of this project is to build an accessible routing and navigation system for wheelchair users to get to their destination from any source location. We determine accessible routes by classifying surfaces from vibration data. In existing mapping systems, the developers rarely consider the experience of the persons with disabilities in most cases. For example, wheelchair users may encounter steep slopes or other barriers in the built environment which they cannot overcome, or uneven road surfaces and broken sidewalks that are not suitable for wheeled navigation. In order to solve this problem and improve the user experience, we proposed the MyPath solution. We analyze and classify the data collected by sensors and then using the ML model to predict any new surface data available during the testing phase of the system. The road surface information is then updated in a research-oriented open-source mapping system known as the OpenStreetMap (OSM). Finally, we combine the user's personalized requirements and the accessibility of each road to generate an accessible route for wheelchair users through the use of Graphhopper API which is a dedicated routing engine for the OSM.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p> Due to the wide variation in user-wheelchair-environment combinations, it is simply impossible to collect data from every different type of user on all possible types of wheelchairs covering all the different surfaces of the world. Therefore, we applied a two-pronged approach to solve this problem. We use a sensor-based data collection and path classification module for training the system on certain amounts of data. We use that data and knowledge to deduce information about other types of users, wheelchairs and surfaces. This project gives a very basic idea of knowledge transfer by the use of transfer learning techniques. Also, in response to the darth of a significant amount of sensor generated surface data, we have employed an image based surface classification system in this work. We collected surface images using a car-mounted Go-Pro camera and classified surfaces using a large set of images which we used to train another machine learning model. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that allows you to learn data iteratively and analyze models. Machine learning plays a big role in MyPath project because we need to analyze the wheelchair travel of a large number of users. When the model encounters new data, we need to use iterations to guide the machine to adapt to the new data independently.</p>

          <p>The project’s target audience is people with disabilities which affect their physical movement (i.e. people who use wheelchairs, crutches, etc). The app, however, can be used by anyone in the general public since it will help the user to navigate from point A to point B by giving an accessibl route to them.</p>

        <h3>Client Side Working of the App </h3>
        
        <p>The user enters source and destination location coordinates to initiate a route request. The server returns multiple accessible routes with different path features which are then personalized based on user preferences such as acceptable curb heights, or slopes. Also, a textual navigation pane is provided for the chosen route which gives turn-by-turn navigational instructions with distance, time and surface type information to cover each section of the route.</p>

          In order to provide individuals with restricted mobility the opportunity to travel more efficiently, various systems have proposed modeling techniques and routing algorithms that handle accessible navigation through the built environment which is otherwise dotted with mobility barriers. Such systems use data gathered from smartphone sensors or crowd-sourcing to pinpoint the location of the barriers as well as the facilities, such as crosswalks with traffic signals or access ramps to curbs. Though the previous works have identified the type of surface and incline to be important features to determine accessibility, no extensive empirical research exists on how these parameters affect navigation. In order to address this problem, we propose to build a novel system called WheelShare, which uses machine learning to classify surfaces into accessible or otherwise and uses that knowledge to generate accessible routes for wheelchair users. We have trained our system with accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from 26 different surfaces found frequently in indoor and outdoor environments across Europe and USA. More data is collected by the system through crowd-sourcing based contribution from interested users. Our evaluation shows that WheelShare can achieve an accuracy of up to 96% in identifying surfaces in one of the 5 different accessibility classes. Overall, WheelShare is a novel, scalable and data-centric approach to objectively identify the accessible features of a surface and can generate end-to-end routes for wheelchair users using frequently updated crowd-sourced information.

        <h4>Sensor Data</h4>
        
        <p>We have used sensor data to train the ML model on the road surfaces which users access with a wheelchair. In the Machine Learning code, we use 80% supervised learning and 20% unsupervised learning for all models. We have decided to use Random Forests(RF) and Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) as the final Machine Learning Models. Although deep learning is more expensive, we have still chosen deep learning because machine learning provides only a simple level of feature extraction, and some information with discrimination cannot be extracted effectively. Some models need to be artificially designed or applied to certain features as input to the Machine Learning model. After model decision, we have used Transfer Learning to transfer manual wheelchair dataset to power wheelchair dataset. The reason we used transfer learning is that there is a significant difference between the two datasets. <br> Here are the various models we used: </p>

          <p>Sometimes the users are not able to access the wheelchair, thus we have implemented another approach to evaluate accessibility by using images collected from many different accessible surfaces to train a computer vision based model. </p>
        
          <br>

          <h4>Labeling</h4>
          
          <p>Using LabelMe library in Jupyter Notebook to identify each surface type and barriers in the image.</p>
          
          <br>

          <h4>Image Processing</h4>
          
          <p>We have decided to build up the model base on Deeplabv3 and Resnet101. First, we prepare the images and mask data and set them up for training, then we run the training process of the model and finally we evaluate the predictions and model performances. After that we are able to cut down the loss to around 0.3 level and we are able to add this new feature to the project. </p>
